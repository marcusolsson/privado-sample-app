# Sample application for Privado

This sample application was built to complement the blog post on [Privacy code scanning with Privado](https://marcusolsson.dev/privacy-code-scanning-with-privado/).

The Git branches in this repository correspond to the steps in the tutorial, with the `main` branch representing the finished application:

1. `start-here`
2. `sources`
3. `storage`
4. `leakages` (same as `main`)
